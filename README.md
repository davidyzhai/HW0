1. The intended platform for the final project is Android
2. The intended framework/progamming language for my final project is Kotlin
3. I would be willing to explore cross-platform development
4. The reason I prefer to do development for Android using Kotlin is that I have reliable access to Android devices for testing. I do wish to work with a team, however. In class, it seemed most people wanted to do IOS development, and I am able to borrow a mac/use a friend's iphone to do iOS development using Swift.
